### Italics
Surround text in either asterisks or underscores to use italics.

`This is in *italics*, and so is _this_.` => This is in *italics* and so is _this_.

### Bold
Surround text in either *two* asterisks or *two* underscores to bold.

`This is **bold** and so is __this__.` => This is **bold** and so is __this__.

### Bold Italics
You can combine asterisks and underscores, two of one and one of the other, to apply both bold and italics.

`Both **_bold_** and __*italics*__.` ==> Both **_bold_** and __*italics*__.
